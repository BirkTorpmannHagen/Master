abstract = {Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) is an active field in natural language processing with many successful developed models in recent years. Despite their high in-distribution accuracy, these models suffer from two issues: high training cost and low out-of-distribution accuracy. Even though some approaches have been presented to tackle the generalization problem, they have high, intolerable training costs. In this paper, we investigate the effect of ensemble learning as a light approach to improve out-of-distribution generalization of MRC systems by aggregating the outputs of some pre-trained base models without retraining a big model. After separately training the base models with different structures on different datasets, they are ensembled using weighting and stacking approaches in probabilistic and non-probabilistic settings. Three configurations are investigated including heterogeneous, homogeneous, and hybrid on eight datasets and six state-of-the-art models. We identify the important factors in the effectiveness of ensemble methods. Also, we compare the robustness of ensemble and fine-tuned models against data distribution shifts. The experimental results show the effectiveness and robustness of the ensemble approach in improving the out-of-distribution accuracy of MRC systems, especially when the base models are similar in accuracies.}

abstract="Domain generalizable model is attracting increasing attention in medical image analysis since data is commonly acquired from different institutes with various imaging protocols and scanners. To tackle this challenging domain generalization problem, we propose a Domain Composition and Attention-based network (DCA-Net) to improve the ability of domain representation and generalization. First, we present a domain composition method that represents one certain domain by a linear combination of a set of basis representations (i.e., a representation bank). Second, a novel plug-and-play parallel domain preceptor is proposed to learn these basis representations and we introduce a divergence constraint function to encourage the basis representations are as divergent as possible. Then, a domain attention module is proposed to learn the linear combination coefficients of the basis representations. The result of liner combination is used to calibrate the feature maps of an input image, which enables the model to generalize to different and even unseen domains. We validate our method on public prostate MRI dataset acquired from six different institutions with apparent domain shift. Experimental results show that our proposed model can generalizes well on different and even unseen domains and it outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the multi-domain prostate segmentation task. Code is available at https://github.com/HiLab-git/DCA-Net.",

abstract = {Chest X-ray images are used in deep convolutional neural networks for the detection of COVID-19, the greatest human challenge of the 21st century. Robustness to noise and improvement of generalization are the major challenges in designing these networks. In this paper, we introduce a strategy for data augmentation using the determination of the type and value of noise density to improve the robustness and generalization of deep CNNs for COVID-19 detection. Firstly, we present a learning-to-augment approach that generates new noisy variants of the original image data with optimized noise density. We apply a Bayesian optimization technique to control and choose the optimal noise type and its parameters. Secondly, we propose a novel data augmentation strategy, based on denoised X-ray images, that uses the distance between denoised and original pixels to generate new data. We develop an autoencoder model to create new data using denoised images corrupted by the Gaussian and impulse noise. A database of chest X-ray images, containing COVID-19 positive, healthy, and non-COVID pneumonia cases, is used to fine-tune the pre-trained networks (AlexNet, ShuffleNet, ResNet18, and GoogleNet). The proposed method performs better results compared to the state-of-the-art learning to augment strategies in terms of sensitivity (0.808), specificity (0.915), and F-Measure (0.737). The source code of the proposed method is available at https://github.com/mohamadmomeny/Learning-to-augment-strategy.}

	abstract  = "BACKGROUND: It is widely accepted that the adenoma-carcinoma
	sequence represents the process by which most, if not all,
	colorectal cancers arise. The evidence supporting this
	hypothesis has increased rapidly in recent years and the purpose
	of this article is to review this evidence critically and
	highlight its clinical significance. METHODS: Medline searches
	were used to identify recent key articles relating to the
	adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Further pertinent articles were
	obtained by manual scanning of the reference lists of identified
	papers. RESULTS: The evidence supporting the adenoma-carcinoma
	sequence can be classified as epidemiological,
	clinicopathological and genetic. The most recent and largest
	body of data relates to molecular genetic events and their
	cellular effects; however, many other approaches, such as
	cytogenetics, molecular cytogenetics and cytometry, have also
	yielded valuable information. CONCLUSION: Recent work continues
	to support the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, but there is a
	paucity of data on the interrelationship between different
	genetic mutations and on the relationship between molecular and
	other types of genetic abnormalities. The clinical utility of
	the observations described has yet to be fully realized and
	global genetic analysis of colorectal tumours may prove to be
	central in rational adenoma management.",

	have been calculated in a few tandem or back-to-back colonoscopy
	studies. Our objective was to assess the adenoma miss rate while
	limiting technique or operator expertise biases, i. e. by
	performing a large multicenter study, with same-day back-to-back
	video colonoscopy, done by two different operators in randomized
	order and blinded to the other examination. PATIENTS AND
	METHODS: 294 patients at 11 centers were included. Among the 286
	analyzable tandem colonoscopies, miss rates were calculated in
	both a lesion- and patient-based analysis. Each of these rates
	was determined for polyps overall, for adenomas, and then for
	lesions larger than 5 mm, and for advanced adenomas. Univariate
	and logistic regression analysis were performed to define
	independent variables associated with missed polyps or adenomas.
	RESULTS: The miss rates for polyps, adenomas, polyps > or = 5
	mm, adenomas > or = 5 mm, and advanced adenomas were,
	respectively, 28 \%, 20 \%, 12 \%, 9 \% and 11 \%. None of the
	masses with a carcinomatous (n = 3) or carcinoid component (n =
	1) was missed. The specific lesion miss rates for patients with
	polyps and adenomas were respectively 36 \% and 26 \% but the
	corresponding rates were 23 \% and 9.4 \% when calculated for
	all 286 patients. The diameter (1-mm increments) and number of
	polyps (> or = 3) were independently associated with a lower
	polyp miss rate, whereas sessile or flat shape and left location
	were significantly associated with a higher miss rate. Adequacy
	of cleansing, presence of diverticula, and duration of
	withdrawal for the first procedure were not associated with
	adenoma miss rate. CONCLUSIONS: We confirm a significant miss
	rate for polyps or adenoma during colonoscopy. Detection of flat
	polyps is an issue that must be focused on to improve the
	quality of colonoscopy.",

	second colonoscopy by the same or a different endoscopist and in
	the same or different position. RESULTS: The overall miss rate
	for adenomas was 24\%, 27\% for adenomas or = 1 cm. Patients
	with two or more adenomas at the first examination were more
	likely than patients with no or one adenoma detected at the
	first examination to have one or more adenomas at the second
	examination (odds ratio, 3.3; 95\% confidence interval,
	1.69-6.46). Right colon adenomas were missed more often (27\%)
	than left colon adenomas (21\%), but the difference was not
	significant. There was evidence of variation in sensitivity
	between endoscopists, but significant miss rates for small
	adenomas were found among essentially all endoscopists.

	AI increased adenoma detection rates (ADRs) and polyp detection
	rates (PDRs) compared to colonoscopy without AI (values given

	was no difference in detection of advanced adenomas (mean
	advanced adenomas per colonoscopy 0.03 for each group, high
