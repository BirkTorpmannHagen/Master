	abstract  = "BACKGROUND: It is widely accepted that the adenoma-carcinoma
	sequence represents the process by which most, if not all,
	colorectal cancers arise. The evidence supporting this
	hypothesis has increased rapidly in recent years and the purpose
	of this article is to review this evidence critically and
	highlight its clinical significance. METHODS: Medline searches
	were used to identify recent key articles relating to the
	adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Further pertinent articles were
	obtained by manual scanning of the reference lists of identified
	papers. RESULTS: The evidence supporting the adenoma-carcinoma
	sequence can be classified as epidemiological,
	clinicopathological and genetic. The most recent and largest
	body of data relates to molecular genetic events and their
	cellular effects; however, many other approaches, such as
	cytogenetics, molecular cytogenetics and cytometry, have also
	yielded valuable information. CONCLUSION: Recent work continues
	to support the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, but there is a
	paucity of data on the interrelationship between different
	genetic mutations and on the relationship between molecular and
	other types of genetic abnormalities. The clinical utility of
	the observations described has yet to be fully realized and
	global genetic analysis of colorectal tumours may prove to be
	central in rational adenoma management.",

	abstract  = "BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIM: Polyp miss rates during colonoscopy
	have been calculated in a few tandem or back-to-back colonoscopy
	studies. Our objective was to assess the adenoma miss rate while
	limiting technique or operator expertise biases, i. e. by
	performing a large multicenter study, with same-day back-to-back
	video colonoscopy, done by two different operators in randomized
	order and blinded to the other examination. PATIENTS AND
	METHODS: 294 patients at 11 centers were included. Among the 286
	analyzable tandem colonoscopies, miss rates were calculated in
	both a lesion- and patient-based analysis. Each of these rates
	was determined for polyps overall, for adenomas, and then for
	lesions larger than 5 mm, and for advanced adenomas. Univariate
	and logistic regression analysis were performed to define
	independent variables associated with missed polyps or adenomas.
	RESULTS: The miss rates for polyps, adenomas, polyps > or = 5
	mm, adenomas > or = 5 mm, and advanced adenomas were,
	respectively, 28 \%, 20 \%, 12 \%, 9 \% and 11 \%. None of the
	masses with a carcinomatous (n = 3) or carcinoid component (n =
	1) was missed. The specific lesion miss rates for patients with
	polyps and adenomas were respectively 36 \% and 26 \% but the
	corresponding rates were 23 \% and 9.4 \% when calculated for
	all 286 patients. The diameter (1-mm increments) and number of
	polyps (> or = 3) were independently associated with a lower
	polyp miss rate, whereas sessile or flat shape and left location
	were significantly associated with a higher miss rate. Adequacy
	of cleansing, presence of diverticula, and duration of
	withdrawal for the first procedure were not associated with
	adenoma miss rate. CONCLUSIONS: We confirm a significant miss
	rate for polyps or adenoma during colonoscopy. Detection of flat
	polyps is an issue that must be focused on to improve the
	quality of colonoscopy.",

	METHODS: Two consecutive same day colonoscopies were performed

	second colonoscopy by the same or a different endoscopist and in
	the same or different position. RESULTS: The overall miss rate
	for adenomas was 24\%, 27\% for adenomas or = 1 cm. Patients
	with two or more adenomas at the first examination were more
	likely than patients with no or one adenoma detected at the
	first examination to have one or more adenomas at the second
	examination (odds ratio, 3.3; 95\% confidence interval,
	1.69-6.46). Right colon adenomas were missed more often (27\%)
	than left colon adenomas (21\%), but the difference was not
	significant. There was evidence of variation in sensitivity
	between endoscopists, but significant miss rates for small
	adenomas were found among essentially all endoscopists.
	CONCLUSIONS: Using current colonoscopic technology, there are

	abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based polyp detection
	systems are used during colonoscopy with the aim of increasing
	lesion detection and improving colonoscopy quality. PATIENTS AND
	METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of
	prospective trials to determine the value of AI-based polyp
	detection systems for detection of polyps and colorectal cancer.
	We performed systematic searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and
	Cochrane CENTRAL. Independent reviewers screened studies and
	assessed eligibility, certainty of evidence, and risk of bias.
	We compared colonoscopy with and without AI by calculating
	relative and absolute risks and mean differences for detection
	of polyps, adenomas, and colorectal cancer. RESULTS: Five
	randomized trials were eligible for analysis. Colonoscopy with
	AI increased adenoma detection rates (ADRs) and polyp detection
	rates (PDRs) compared to colonoscopy without AI (values given
	with 95 \%CI). ADR with AI was 29.6 \% (22.2 \% - 37.0 \%)
	versus 19.3 \% (12.7 \% - 25.9 \%) without AI; relative risk
	(RR] 1.52 (1.31 - 1.77), with high certainty. PDR was 45.4 \%
	(41.1 \% - 49.8 \%) with AI versus 30.6 \% (26.5 \% - 34.6 \%)
	without AI; RR 1.48 (1.37 - 1.60), with high certainty. There
	was no difference in detection of advanced adenomas (mean
	advanced adenomas per colonoscopy 0.03 for each group, high
	certainty). Mean adenomas detected per colonoscopy was higher
	for small adenomas ($\leq$ 5 mm) for AI versus non-AI (mean
	difference 0.15 [0.12 - 0.18]), but not for larger adenomas (> 5
	- $\leq$ 10 mm, mean difference 0.03 [0.01 - 0.05]; > 10 mm,
	mean difference 0.01 [0.00 - 0.02]; high certainty). Data on
	cancer are unavailable. CONCLUSIONS: AI-based polyp detection
	systems during colonoscopy increase detection of small
	nonadvanced adenomas and polyps, but not of advanced adenomas.",
